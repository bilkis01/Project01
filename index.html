            <p>Programs include country, culture and activity nights, along with international fun nights. Residents are given the chance to plan and organize a program of their choosing for everyone to enjoy. The majority of these programs are open to the entire USI community, although special community-building programs are offered exclusively to residents of the Global Community. Trips are also occasionally offered that allow students to bond, participate in fun and educational events, and see more of the Midwest. The Global Community allows friendships to develop across all cultures along with respect and appreciation for the world at large, while celebrating our colorful diversity.</p> <br> <br>
